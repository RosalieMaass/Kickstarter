# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
- Using the Kickstarter dataset, we will look at campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals. We will look at successful, failed, and canceled campaigns per months of the year.

- The purpose is to see how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals, to see what was the most and least successful. Then Louise can plan her future campaigns during the time of year, and length of time, that has the highest success rate.

## Analysis and Challenges
Using Tables and Graphs, we can visualize this data easily. One challenge was making sure the formulas were correct to pull the appropriate data from the original excel sheet. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We created a PivotTable with the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns per month. Then we created a PivotGraph with this same information. By looking at the information in the pivot table and the pivot graph, it is determined that May had the highest rate of successful theater campaigns. December had the lowest number of successful theater campaigns.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We created a new sheet with the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns broken down by goal amounts. We created a line graph with this information. The successful vs unsuccessful data mirrors itself since it is shown in percentages and there were no canceled campaigns in this data, resulting in just 2 data points, successful and unsuccessful. 
With this data we can see that the highest rate of successful campaigns came from campaigns with goals between $0-$4999, and $35,000-$44,999. However, the 35,000-44,999 range only had 9 total projects, where the $0-$4999 range had 720 projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
- The main challenge I encountered was an incorrect formula. This was corrected by checking my work and then scanning each cell for formula consistency.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
May had the most successful launches and December had the smallest number of successful launches.


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Goals that are between $0-$4999 have the highest success rate. The highest failure rate was with goals that were $45,000 and higher.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data set only looked at theater and play sub categories. It could be helpful to look at other categories. It could also be broken down by year to see if there are differences in more recent years.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could break it down by year. Fundraising trends change over time and older or newer information may skew these results in a different direction.
